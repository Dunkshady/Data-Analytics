# 🌐 Chase Eveleth - Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to the official source code for my personal portfolio site! This fully responsive and modern web project showcases my resume, cover letter, and career goals, complete with interactive elements, custom styling, and professional polish.

## 🔍 Overview

This site is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a little **JavaScript**, and demonstrates front-end development best practices with a strong emphasis on design, usability, and semantic markup.

Key pages include:

- 📝 `index.html` – Resume
- 💼 `cover-letter.html` – Cover Letter
- 🎯 `career-goals.html` – Career Goals & Contact Form

Each page shares a consistent layout, unified styling, and a glassy, dynamic navbar. Background video, animations (via AOS), and a responsive design make the site engaging and professional.
